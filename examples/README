This directory contains the following:
* configure
    - shell script used on Unix platorms to setup the environment to build
      examples on a specific platform and compiler. This script asks the 
      user questions regarding the platform, compiler and various utility 
      paths and creates a makefile, "makefile.include", that is included by 
      all other makefiles.

* makefile.in 
    - template makefile used by the configure script.

============================================
BUILDING THE RMC EXAMPLES ON UNIX PLATFORMS:
============================================

In order to build the RMC examples, the following steps must be taken:

1) Invoke "sh ./configure" and answer all of the questions is asks.
   You will need to know your platform, C++ compiler path.

2) Invoke "make" in the desired sub-directory. This will build all the
   examples the sub directory.
   
   Optionally, you can also build a particular example by invoking
   "make X" where "X" is the name of a specific example to build.

Note that all executables and object files are put into the same directory 
where the source code resides.
