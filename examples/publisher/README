This directory contains the following:

* main.C
    - The main() routine for a simple application that initializes shared
      memory and its header. It also instantiates the root object of the
      public object tree. 

* root.[Ch]
    - The root object of the application. It instantiates three public
      objects to be its children. 

* userList.[Ch]
    - A child of the root object. It also provides a means to change
      the state of the object via the modification of its public variables.

* user.[Ch]
    - A child of the userList object. It contains various types of
      public variables. Some of these can be set to modify-enabled to allow
      consumer applications to change their values.

* envvar.[Ch]
    - A child of the root object. It contains a function to extract
      environment variables and publishes them to shared memory.

* sysinfo.[Ch]
    - A child of the root object. It contains a function to extract
      the information about the current working directory and publishes
      it to shared memory.

* timedObject.[Ch]
    - A child of the user object. It activates a timer to trigger an update
      of its public variable periodically.
