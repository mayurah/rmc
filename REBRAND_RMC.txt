Overview
============================
The purpose of this document is to provide a guide for customers to 
understand the impact on the applications written using 
Refinitiv Management Classes (RMC) due to Refinitiv Rebranding. 

There is *no* impact on the existing customer applications written using RMC Developer Kit 
due to rebranding. Also, the connectivity to the Refinitiv products will *not* 
be impacted due to rebranding efforts and existing applications will continue to work. 

However, starting with the RMC version 2.2.0.L1, all future fixes will be made 
only on re-branded releases. Post July 2021, non-rebranded versions such as 2.1.0.L3
for example, will no longer be available for download due to licensing reasons. We 
will continue to offer support for non re-branded versions of RMC that includes 
investigating the reported issues and recommending workarounds. Please note that a 
workaround may not always be possible or feasible. Therefore, we recommend moving to 
the re-branded versions of RMC Developer Kit.
